# Front end of my Website
This is a simple html website, built to showcase my CV and skills as an AWS Cloud Engineer. This website is hosted on AWS S3, and connected to a CI/CD pipeline for automatic updates

## Backend Application
There is also a counter at the bottom of the website, that counts website visits, this was built using DynamoDb, API Gateway and Lambda, and the IAC used to deploy was AWS SAM.
